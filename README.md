Linux driver for Contour Design Shuttle Pro V2
==============================================

## About this fork

This is a fork of [abourget/shuttle-go](https://github.com/abourget/shuttle-go)
focused on **better support for GNOME on Wayland**. The upstream project was
built around X11, where it could read the active window title directly and
inject keystrokes with `xdotool`. Neither of those works on Wayland, so this
fork:

* **Reads the active window and the pointer position over D-Bus** via the
  bundled [Shuttle Pro](gnome-extension/) GNOME extension (modeled on
  [window-calls](https://github.com/ickyicky/window-calls)), instead of the X11
  `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` property.
* **Matches on `wm_class`** as well as the window title (see
  [Window matching](#window-matching)), so bindings can target a specific
  application window even when titles are generic.
* **Injects keys directly through a virtual `uinput` device** (the default
  driver) instead of `xdotool`, which works on both X11 and Wayland. No
  external daemon is required. It supports [macro sequences](#macro-sequences)
  (`/type`, `/sleep`, `/exec`, `/mousemove`, `/click`) for richer bindings.
* **Disables the Shuttle's pointer via `libinput`** on Wayland (and `xinput`
  on X11), so the device doesn't move the cursor.
* **Keeps running** across plug/unplug: it waits for the device, and recreates
  the virtual `uinput` device when the Shuttle is reconnected.

The rest of this document describes the (shared) configuration format and
behavior.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use the Shuttle Pro V2 with the
Lightworks Non-Linear Video Editor, but `shuttle-go` allows you
to control anything.  It has support for:

* Sending keyboard events (with the default `uinput` driver)
* Sending Open Source Control messages (with the `ocs://` driver)
* Executing any command through `bash -c` (with the `exec` driver)

This program supports having **modifiers** for your Shuttle Pro V2
buttons.  So you can multiple the functionality of your buttons.  For
example, you can have different bindings for
<kbd>B1</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> and <kbd>F1</kbd>.

## Window matching

Each app in the configuration is selected by matching the active window.
You can match on the window **title** (with `match_window_titles`) and/or
the window's **WM_CLASS** (with `match_wm_class`). Each list holds regular
expressions; a window matching *any* regexp in a list satisfies that
dimension.

- If only one list is present, that dimension alone decides the match.
- If **both** lists are present, **both** must match (AND). This lets you
  target one specific window but not all of them — e.g. a particular Emacs
  buffer while ignoring the rest.

```json
{
    "name": "Emacs - org mode",
    "match_wm_class": ["^Emacs$"],
    "match_window_titles": ["\\*org/.*\\.org\\*"],
    "bindings": { ... }
}
```

Matching on `wm_class` is often more stable than matching on the title,
since the class is set by the application and doesn't change with the
working directory or document name. On Wayland/GNOME the class is read from
the Shuttle Pro extension (see below); on X11 it is read from the `WM_CLASS`
window property.

## Layout

Buttons layout on the Contour Design Shuttle Pro v2:


```

           F1   F2   F3   F4

        F5   F6   F7   F8   F9


                (Shuttle)
        S-7 .. S-1  S0  S1 .. S7

     M1        JogL    JogR        M2



              B2        B3
            B1            B4

```
#### N.B. Contour Design Shuttle Pro v1 has the same buttons layout 


### Slow Jog

In addition to `JogL` and `JogR`, you can define bindings for
`SlowJogL` and `SlowJogR`. For example, you can use a slow jog use to
nudge by one frame at a time.

If you wish to not use slow jog, set the `slow_jog` key to `0` in the
configuration for this app. Otherwise, `slow_jog` represents the
minimum number of milliseconds between two events to be considered
slow. It defaults to 200 ms.


### Lightworks

Avoid Lightworks key bindings with modifiers however. Capital
letters are great as they cannot be combined, and are more direct and
they are less likely to conflict with your other bindings and
Lightworks recognizes them.

### Drivers

See `sample_config.json` for example configuration of each driver.

#### `uinput` (default)

The key names to use in the bindings are found here:
https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/keysymdef.h or you can view them
locally in `/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h` (stripped of the `XK_`
prefix).

This driver emits events through a virtual `uinput` device created by
`shuttle-go` itself (named `shuttle-go-virtual`), so no external tool or
daemon is needed. It must run with permission to open `/dev/uinput`
(typically as root, e.g. via `sudo` or a udev rule).

##### Binding value forms

With the `uinput` driver, a binding's value can be written three ways. All
three decode to the same internal form, so they can be mixed freely within one
app:

* **A plain string** — a single key or key combo (e.g. `"F1": "Escape"`).
  This is the common case and the only form most bindings need.
* **An array of strings** — a [macro sequence](#macro-sequences)
  (e.g. `"F5": ["/type hello", "/click left"]`).
* **An object** — the full form, with per-binding knobs. This is the only form
  that can express `repeat`, `delay_ms`, `start_delay_ms`, and `once`.

The object form's fields (all optional; defaults shown):

* `"key"` — a single key or combo to tap (used when there is no `"macros"`)
* `"macros"` — an array of [macro commands](#macro-sequences) to run
* `"once"` — `true` (default `false`): run the chain exactly once on key-down
  instead of repeating while the button is held
* `"repeat"` — how many times to tap the key (default `1`); only used with
  `"key"`, not with `"macros"`
* `"delay_ms"` — milliseconds between repeats (default `25`)
* `"start_delay_ms"` — milliseconds to wait before the first action (default
  `0`)
* `"comment"` — an optional human note for the binding (e.g. `"Prev clip"`).
  In the string/array forms the note is embedded in the value after `//` or
  `#`; in the object form it lives here, so porting a binding to the object
  form does not lose the note. When present, it takes precedence over any note
  embedded in `"key"`.

A plain key with repeat, for example:

```json
"F1": { "key": "a", "repeat": 3, "delay_ms": 50, "start_delay_ms": 100, "comment": "Prev clip" }
```

##### Macro sequences

A binding whose value is an **array of macro commands** (or an object with a
`"macros"` array) runs those commands in order through the virtual `uinput`
device. Nothing is held or released on key-up; the difference is in how often
the chain runs while the button is held:

* **Default** — the chain runs immediately on key-down, then repeats every
  `delay_ms` (default 25 ms) for as long as the button stays held (like a key
  auto-repeat).
* **`"once": true`** — the chain runs exactly once on key-down and does not
  repeat.

Available macros:

* `"/type <text>"` — types `<text>` through the virtual keyboard
* `"/sleep <seconds>"` — pauses for `<seconds>` seconds (e.g. `1.5`)
* `"/exec <command>"` — runs `<command>` through `bash -c`
* `"/mousemove <x> <y> [absolute]"` — moves the mouse by `<x> <y>`
  relative units; the optional third argument is `true`/`false`, and when
  `true` the move is made absolute (the current pointer position is read
  from `/dev/input/mice` first)
* `"/click <button> [repeats]"` — clicks a mouse button. `<button>` is a
  name: `left`, `right`, `middle`, `side`, `extr`, `forward`, `back` (or the
  corresponding hex codes `0x00`-`0x06`). The optional `repeats` count
  repeats the click (e.g. `"/click left 4"` clicks four times).

Example (a macro chain that repeats while held — the array form):

```json
"F5": [
    "/type hello world",
    "/sleep 1.5",
    "/type !!!",
    "/exec touch /tmp/shuttle-file",
    "/mousemove 500 300 true",
    "/click left"
]
```

Example (a one-shot macro, using the object form with `"once": true`):

```json
"F6": {
    "once": true,
    "macros": [
        "/type one-shot: this runs a single time on press",
        "/click left"
    ]
}
```

The array form above is shorthand for the same object with `"once"` left
unset, so the two are interchangeable.

#### `exec`

Any bindings triggered will execute the corresponding command through
`/bin/bash -c "your command"`

#### `osc://host:port`

In the configuration, use `"driver": "osc://host:port"`, then all your
bindings can be of the format: `/osc/address/path param1 param2
param3`.

You can send multiple messages with one key by separating those
bindings by ` + ` (that's a space, a plus sign, and another space).

A special `/sleep 0.123` message can be added, and it interpreted by
`shuttle-go` as a sleep between two OSC messages. Use that if your
program goes berzerk when messages are too close.


## Run

With:

    sudo shuttle-go /dev/input/by-id/usb-Contour_Design_ShuttlePRO_v2-event-mouse

### Wayland / GNOME

On Wayland (e.g. GNOME), the active window and the pointer position are not
exposed to other applications by default. To let `shuttle-go` read them,
install and enable the bundled [Shuttle Pro](gnome-extension/) GNOME extension,
which exposes both over D-Bus:

    make -C gnome-extension
    gnome-extensions install gnome-extension/shuttle-pro@shuttle-go.dev-v1.0.tar.gz
    gnome-extensions enable shuttle-pro@shuttle-go.dev

(See [gnome-extension/README.md](gnome-extension/README.md) for details.) This
makes the window title, `wm_class`, and pointer position available over D-Bus,
which is how `shuttle-go` reads them.

### For ShuttlePRO_v1
    shuttle-go /dev/input/by-id/usb-Contour_Design_ShuttlePRO-event-mouse

#### N.B. Running shuttle-go as sudo will cause shuttle-go to look for a valid config file in 

    /root/.shuttle-go.json

#### Without sudo, shuttle-go will look for a valid config file in the current user's home dir

    ~/.shuttle-go.json 
         

## Install with Nix (flake)

This project ships a [Nix flake](flake.nix), so you can build and install
`shuttle-go` (and the [Shuttle Pro](gnome-extension/) GNOME extension) without
a separate build step. The flake exposes:

* `packages.shuttle-go` (also `packages.default`) — the `shuttle-go` binary,
  plus a `shuttle-go.desktop` launcher in `share/applications/` so it appears
  in the application menu,
* `packages.shuttle-pro` — the Shuttle Pro GNOME extension,
* `devShells.default` — a dev shell with `go`, `dbus`, and `libinput`.

Build the binary:

    nix build .#shuttle-go --print-out-paths

That prints the store path of the built binary, e.g.
`/nix/store/…-shuttle-go-1.2.3`. Run it directly:

    /nix/store/…-shuttle-go-1.2.3/bin/shuttle-go --version

Install it into your user `PATH` (and keep it up to date with the system) with
a Nix profile:

    nix profile install --profile ~/.nix-profile .#shuttle-go

After that, `shuttle-go` is on your `PATH` and you can run it as shown in the
[Run](#run) section. To update it later, re-run the same `nix profile install`
command (or `nix profile upgrade`).

To install the GNOME extension the same way:

    nix profile install --profile ~/.nix-profile .#shuttle-pro
    gnome-extensions install --enable ~/.nix-profile/share/gnome-shell/extensions/shuttle-pro@shuttle-go.dev

For development, drop into the dev shell:

    nix develop

> **Note:** the Nix build packages the source from the git tree, so build from a
> clean tree (committed changes) to avoid "inconsistent vendoring" errors.

## Example configurations

The [`examples/`](examples/) directory holds ready-made config files, one per
application, in the same JSON format as `~/.shuttle-go.json`. Each file wraps a
single app in an `apps` array, e.g. `examples/editshare_lightworks.json`:

    {
        "apps": [
            {
                "name": "EditShare Lightworks",
                "match_window_titles": [ "EditShare Lightworks", "Lightworks" ],
                "slow_jog": 200,
                "bindings": {
                    "F1": { "key": "V", "comment": "Insert/Swap/Last Out/Full Scr" },
                    "M1": { "key": "Alt+Shift+K", "comment": "Stop" },
                    "JogL": { "key": "Shift+&", "comment": "Jog Rev/Zoom Out" },
                    "S0": { "key": "K", "comment": "Stop" },
                    "S7": { "key": "Alt+Shift+4", "comment": "1000%  Forward" }
                }
            }
        ]
    }

To use one, copy it to your config location (or point `--config` at it):

    cp examples/editshare_lightworks.json ~/.shuttle-go.json

Many of these start from the **official Contour Design Shuttle Pro V2
presets** (the `.ini`/config files Contour ships for each DAW/NLE), translated
into `shuttle-go`'s JSON binding format. So a file like
`examples/adobe_premiere_pro_cc_edit.json` mirrors Contour's Adobe Premiere Pro
CC layout: the same Shuttle buttons mapped to the same editor shortcuts. Pick
the file matching your application, drop it in place, and the bindings take
effect immediately (see [Configuration reloading](#configuration-reloading)).

### Regenerating the examples

The examples are generated from Contour's bundled preset file
(`contour_default_backup.json`) by [`port_contour.py`](port_contour.py). It maps
each Contour control to a Shuttle key, translates the key (and its
`Ctrl`/`Alt`/`Shift` modifiers) to a `shuttle-go` key, and — when a binding
carries a Contour **comment** — emits the object form with a `"comment"` field
so the note is preserved (see [Binding value forms](#binding-value-forms)). To
regenerate all of them:

    python3 port_contour.py

This rewrites every file in `examples/`. Run it after changing the key map or
the binding format, then review the diff before committing.

## Install in `udev` with:

**As root**, write file `/etc/udev/rules.d/01-shuttle-go.rules` with contents:

    ACTION=="add", ATTRS{name}=="Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2", MODE="0644"
    ACTION=="remove", ATTRS{name}=="Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2", RUN+="/usr/bin/pkill shuttle-go"

### For ShuttlePRO_v1

    ACTION=="add", ATTRS{name}=="Contour Design ShuttlePRO", MODE="0644"
    ACTION=="remove", ATTRS{name}=="Contour Design ShuttlePRO", RUN+="/usr/bin/pkill shuttle-go"

Then run, as **root**:

    udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger

From that point on, plug in the device, and run `shuttle-go` in any terminal (provided `shuttle-go` is in your `$PATH`).

## Configuration reloading

`shuttle-go` watches the config file (the one given via `--config`, default
`~/.shuttle-go.json`) and **reloads it automatically when it changes** — no
restart needed. It uses `inotify` for immediate notification on Linux, and falls
back to polling every 5 seconds if `inotify` is unavailable. If an edit is
invalid (e.g. a broken regexp or malformed JSON), the reload is skipped and the
previous configuration stays in effect until the file is fixed.

## TODO

* Have a default SlowJog configuration.

* Make it auto-run on plug, with `udev` rules like:

```
    ACTION=="add", ATTRS{name}=="Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2", ENV{MINOR}=="79", RUN+="/home/abourget/go/src/github.com/abourget/shuttle-go/udev-start.sh"
    ACTION=="remove", ATTRS{name}=="Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2", RUN+="/usr/bin/pkill shuttle-go"
```
